# Positivus

A modern, responsive landing page built in **React.js**, based on a Figma design template. This project showcases the fictional company **Positivus**, delivering a clean, professional, and visually appealing web experience. The goal of this project is to faithfully translate a Figma UI design into production‑ready code using modern frontend tools and workflows.

## 📌 Project Overview

Positivus is a single‑page landing website built to mirror the structure, layout, and styling of a provided Figma design. The project focuses on:

- Smooth and responsive layout across all screen sizes
- Clean and maintainable code architecture
- Semantic and accessible React.js components

This project can serve as a boilerplate for future landing pages or UI prototype conversions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

The project leverages the following technologies:

### **Frontend**

- **React.js** — UI framework for building component‑based user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility‑first CSS framework for rapid styling.
- **Tailwind‑Fluid Plugin** — Used to create fluid responsive typography and spacing.
- **Sass (SCSS)** — Enhances styling flexibility with variables, mixins, and nesting.

### **Tooling & Configuration**

- **Vite** — Fast development environment.
- **PostCSS** — Processes Tailwind CSS and plugin configurations.
- **Prettier** — For consistent code formatting.

## 🎨 Design Implementation

The UI layout follows the original Figma design closely:

- Responsive padding, spacing, and font sizes achieved with **tailwind‑fluid**
- Component‑based architecture for modularity (Hero, Features, About, CTA, Footer, etc.)
- Custom SCSS for global styles and reusable design tokens
